This project is aimed at gluing yaml files containing paths and definitions of a swagger specification with the rest of the specification file.

STRUCTURE
- The original specification file should be saved as 'spec.yaml' in the root directory of the project
- Path specifications should be made in the '/paths' directory.
- Definition specifications should be made in the '/definitions' directory.
- Path and Definiton files should be written with proper indentation.
- Placeholders "#$:PATHS" and "#$:DEFINITIONS" should be placed in "spec.yaml" on the lines where the paths and definitions should begin respectively (See the sample "spec.yaml" file in the root direcroy)

USAGE
- Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal
- From here, run "python gluestick.py"
- The output specification file is generated and saved as "final_spec.yaml".

NB: "final-spec.yaml" is overwritten anytime "python gluestick.py" is executed
